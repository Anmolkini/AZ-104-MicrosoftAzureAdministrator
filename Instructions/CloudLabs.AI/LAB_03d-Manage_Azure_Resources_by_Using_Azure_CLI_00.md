# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Now that you explored the basic Azure administration capabilities associated with provisioning resources and organizing them based on resource groups by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, and Azure PowerShell, you need to carry out the equivalent task by using Azure CLI. To avoid installing Azure CLI, you will leverage Bash environment available in Azure Cloud Shell.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Start a Bash session in Azure Cloud Shell
+ Task 2: Create a resource group and an Azure managed disk by using Azure CLI
+ Task 3: Configure the managed disk by using Azure CLI

## Estimated timing: 20 minutes
